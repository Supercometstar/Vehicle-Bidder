**Vehicle Automatic Bidder**
==========================

**Overview**
------------

Vehicle Automatic Bidder is a comprehensive system designed to automate the bidding process for vehicles. The system consists of three main parts: Front-end, Back-end, and Engine.

**System Components**
--------------------

### 1. Front-end

* Built using: **React** with **Material-UI (Mui)**
* Description: The front-end provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system. It handles user input, displays bidding information, and updates the user on the bidding status.

### 2. Back-end

* Built using: **Express**
* Description: The back-end handles the server-side logic, manages data storage, and provides APIs for the front-end to consume. It ensures secure and efficient data exchange between the front-end and the engine.

### 3. Engine

* Built using: **Puppeteer**
* Description: The engine is the core of the system, responsible for automating the bidding process. It uses Puppeteer to simulate user interactions, navigate bidding websites, and place bids on behalf of the user.
